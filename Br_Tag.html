        A novel is a long, fictional narrative.

        The novel in the modern era
         usually makes use of a literary prose style. 
        The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing, and the introduction of 
        cheap paper in the 15th century.
        Fictional narrative: Fictionality is most commonly cited as
         distinguishing novels from historiography. However this can 
         be a problematic criterion. Throughout the early modern period <br><br><br>
         authors of historical narratives would often include inventions
          rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of 
          text or add credibility to an opinion.

            Historians would also invent
            and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other
             hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of
              a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works 
              of history. 
         Several novels, for example Ông cố vấn written by Hữu Mai, were designed to be and defined as a "non-fiction" novel
          which purposefully recorded historical facts in the form of a novel.
