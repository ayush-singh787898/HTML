        A novel is a long, fictional narrative.

        The<b> novel</b> in the modern era
         usually makes use of a <strong> prose sytle.</strong>  
        The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing, and the introduction of 
        cheap paper in the 15th century.
        Fictional narrative: Fictionality is most commonly cited as
        distinguishing novels from historiography. However this can 
        be a problematic criterion. Throughout the early modern period 
        authors of historical narratives would often include inventions
        rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of 
        text or add credibility to an opinion.
